# MergeBalls

MergeBalls is a pazzle game made with Python and Panda3D.
Rules are simple. Only need to combine balls with the same color, size and shape continually, until a smiley is finally generated to jump up. When combined, the balls burst into flames, or sparkles. I made such visual effects through a lot of trial and error.
