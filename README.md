# MergeBalls

MergeBalls is a pazzle game made with Python and Panda3D.
Rules are simple. Only need to combine balls with the same color, size and shape continually, until a smiley is finally generated to jump up. When combined, the balls burst into flames, or sparkles. I made such visual effects through a lot of trial and error.

# Requirements
* Panda3D 1.10.13

# Environment
* Python 3.11
* Windows11

# Usage
* Execute a command below on your command line.
* Click on a ball.
